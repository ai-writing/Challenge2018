Prerequisites
-------------
======================  ======================
Package name            How to get it?
======================  ======================
Node.js (includes npm)  https://nodejs.org/en/
Python 3 (recommended)  https://www.python.org/downloads/
PostgreSQL              https://www.postgresql.org/download/
======================  ======================

Installation
------------

请参考本项目的 `Wiki 页面`_。

.. _Wiki 页面: https://github.com/ai-writing/Challenge2018/wiki/Installation

In general, before running shell commands, set the ``FLASK_APP`` and
``FLASK_DEBUG`` environment variables ::

    export FLASK_APP=autoapp.py
    export FLASK_DEBUG=1

Troubleshoot: If there's an error while running npm, consider upgrading to the latest version.


Back-end Development
--------------------

和后端开发有关的资源都在 ``papersmith/editor/`` 目录下。

后端的语法、语义、句式检查分别作为一个 python package，存放在上述文件夹中。以 ``grammar`` package 为例，其中包含 ``grammar.py`` module，实现一个 ``check(content)`` 函数，其中 content 是前端传来的用户文章。

文章例子： ::

    In 2014, we organized the first workshop about the creative community, it had attracted more than 40 people from government agencies, social organizations, business circles, IT experts and design professional teachers and students to participate.The design of the six teams are based on Internet.

    Communication technology such as Internet of things, sensor network and so on, so as to form a new management form community based on large-scale information intelligent processing.

    Six teams results varied, respectively: the design of electronic waste recycling platform, the prototype design of community old-age self-help, the design of remote control robot, Babel Tower breaker Bracelet design, the design of the joint office, commercial exhibition and creative communication space design and the design of City pet dog intelligence community.

对于每个发现的问题，封装成 ``Issue`` 格式 (``papersmith/editor/issue.py``) ::

    category:       1语法/2语义/3句式
    itype:          issue 类型：1错误/2建议/3普通；
    start:          起始下标，列表
    end:            终止下标+1，列表
    replacement:    替换成的字符串
    exp_id:         解释的编号

注意 ``start`` 和 ``end`` 是 ``list`` 类型，即使分别只有一个下标。非常简单的使用样例请看 ``papersmith/editor/grammar/grammar-example.py``。


Front-end Development
---------------------

Access the API at ``localhost:5000/check/``. Sample format: ::

    {
        "count": {
            "errorGrammar": 1, 
            "errorSemantic": 0, 
            "errorSpelling": 0, 
            "errorStructure": 0, 
            "id": 1, 
            "suggestGrammar": 0, 
            "suggestSemantic": 0, 
            "suggestSpelling": 0, 
            "suggestStructure": 0, 
            "sumNum": 1
        }, 
        "grammar": {
            "err": [
            {
                "cat": 1, 
                "eid": 3, 
                "end": [19], 
                "rep": "replacement", 
                "start": [15], 
                "type": 1
            }
            ], 
            "sug": []
        }, 
        "semantic": {
            "err": [], 
            "sug": []
        }, 
        "spelling": {
            "err": [], 
            "sug": []
        }, 
        "structure": {
            "err": [], 
            "sug": []
        }, 
        "success": 1
    }

Deployment
----------

To deploy::

    export FLASK_DEBUG=0
    npm run build   # build assets with webpack
    flask run       # start the flask server

In your production environment, make sure the ``FLASK_DEBUG`` environment
variable is unset or is set to ``0``, so that ``ProdConfig`` is used.


Shell
-----

To open the interactive shell, run ::

    flask shell

By default, you will have access to the flask ``app``.


Running Tests
-------------

To run all tests, run ::

    flask test


Migrations
----------

Whenever a database migration needs to be made. Run the following commands ::

    flask db migrate

This will generate a new migration script. Then run ::

    flask db upgrade

To apply the migration.

For a full migration command reference, run ``flask db --help``.


Asset Management
----------------

Files placed inside the ``assets`` directory and its subdirectories
(excluding ``js`` and ``css``) will be copied by webpack's
``file-loader`` into the ``static/build`` directory, with hashes of
their contents appended to their names.  For instance, if you have the
file ``assets/img/favicon.ico``, this will get copied into something
like
``static/build/img/favicon.fec40b1d14528bf9179da3b6b78079ad.ico``.
You can then put this line into your header::

    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{asset_url_for('img/favicon.ico') }}">

to refer to it inside your HTML page.  If all of your static files are
managed this way, then their filenames will change whenever their
contents do, and you can ask Flask to tell web browsers that they
should cache all your assets forever by including the following line
in your ``settings.py``::

    SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT = 31556926  # one year
