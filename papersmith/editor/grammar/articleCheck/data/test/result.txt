last week i went to the theate . i had a very good seat . the play was very interesting . i did not enjoy it . a young man and a young woman were sitting behind me . they were talking loudly . i got very angry . i could not hear the actors . i turned round . i looked at the man and the woman angrily . they did not pay any attention . in the end , i could not bear it . i turned round again . ' i ca n't hear a word ! ' i said angrily . ` it 's none of your business , ' the young man said rudely . ` this is a private conversation ! ' it was sunday . i never get up early on sundays . i sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime . last sunday i got up very late . i looked out of the window . it was dark outside . ` what a day ! ' i thought . ` it 's raining again . ' just then , the telephone rang . it was my aunt lucy . ` i 've just arrived by train , ' she said . ` i 'm coming to see you . ' ` but i 'm still having breakfast , ' i said . ` what are you doing ? ' she asked . ` i 'm having breakfast , ' i repeated . ` dear me , ' she said . ` do you always get up so late ? it 's one o'clock ! ' postcards always spoil my holidays . last summer , i went to italy . i visited museums and sat in public gardens . a friendly waiter taught me a few words of italian . then he lent me a book . i read a few lines , but i did not understand a word . everyday i thought about postcards . my holidays passed quickly , but i did not send cards to my friends . on the last day i made a big decision . i got up early and bought thirty-seven cards . i spent the whole day in my room , but i did not write a single card ! i have just received a letter from my brother , tim . he is in australia . he has been there for six months . tim is an engineer . he is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in australia . he has just bought an australian car and has gone to alice springs , a small town in the centre of australia . he will soon visit darwin . from there , he will fly to perth . my brother has never been abrad before , so he is fending this trip very exciting . mr . james scott has a garage in silbury and now he has just bought another garage in pinhurst . pinhurst is only five miles from silbury , but mr. scott can not get a telephone for his new garage , so he has just bought twelve pigeons . yesterday , a pigeon carried the first message from pinhurst to silbury . the bird covered the distance in three minutes . up to now , mr . scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other . in this way , he has begun his own private ` telephone ' service . i have just moved to a house in bridge street . yesterday a beggar knocked at my door . he asked me for a meal and a glass of beer . in return for this , the beggar stood on his head and sang songs . i gave him a meal . he ate the food and drank the beer . then he put a piece of cheese in his pokcet and went away . later a neighbour told me about him . everybody knows him . his name is percy buttons . he calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer .
